This is a Harvard Case Study on Lending Club. We have applied Supervised algorithms techniques such as 'Multivariate Logistic Regression, Recursize feature elimination, Principal component decomposition (PCA)' on the dataset (from 2007-2017).

Our goal was to classify whether a customer will be classified as 'Defaulter' or not via out model. We took data from 2007 to 2017 after which we sliced the data from 2010 to 2014 and that is going to be our point of reference for the model building.
